"""Non-Pedantic Time
=================

.. moduleauthor:: Thomas Grenfell Smith <thomathom@gmail.com>

Python's :mod:`datetime` module has many uses, but it has a difficulty: you
can't do any arithmetic with :class:`datetime.time`.  Only with
:class:`datetime.datetime`.  Now, there are good reasons for this:  "What time
will it be, 24 hours from now" has a lot of corner cases, including daylight
savings time, leap seconds, historical timezone changes, and so on.  But
sometimes you really *do* need the simple case.  Sometimes the perfect is the
enemy of the good.  And that's why you have this module.  This module will allow
you to cocoon yourself in the comforting illusion that, in 24 hours, it will be
the same time as it is right now.

And what freedom this illusion gives you!  You can add a
:class:`datetime.timedelta` object to an :mod:`nptime` object, and it works! It
will cycle around 24 hours, like modular arithmetic.  You can ask "what time
comes 1 day and 36 minutes after 12:24 pm?" and it will let you know: 1:00 pm.
How lovely!

>>> from nptime import nptime
>>> from datetime import timedelta, date, datetime
>>> afternoon = nptime(12, 24) + timedelta(days=1, minutes=36)
>>> afternoon
nptime(13, 0)
>>> str(afternoon)
'13:00:00'

Maybe we're talking about the afternoon of Guido van Rossum's birthday.  Lucky,
we can combine ``nptime`` objects with ``date`` objects:

>>> datetime.combine(date(1956, 1, 31), afternoon)
datetime.datetime(1956, 1, 31, 13, 0)

You can also ask "How long is it between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM?  It sure
feels like a million years!"

>>> workday = nptime(hour=17) - nptime(hour=9)
>>> workday
datetime.timedelta(0, 28800)
>>> print(workday)
8:00:00

Nope, only 8 hours, how strange.  Anyway, please use this module.  It will
be convenient.  But don't use it when talking about concrete time, time in
a particular place, or anything like that.  In fact, it doesn't even notice
:class:`datetime.tzinfo` objects right now.  Good luck.

    """nptime - a non-pedantic time object

    Inherits from :class:`datetime.time`.  You can't do arithmetic with that
    class, but with ``nptime`` you can:

    * Add a :class:`datetime.timedelta` to an :class:`nptime` (commutative),
        resulting in another ``nptime``
    * Subtract a ``timedelta`` from an ``nptime``, resulting in a 
        ``timedelta``
    * Subtract an ``nptime`` from another ``nptime``, resulting in a 
        ``timedelta``

    You can use the class methods :func:`from_timedelta` and :func:`from_time`
    to construct an ``nptime`` from those ``datetime`` classes.  You can use the
    :func:`to_timedelta` instance method to construct a ``timedelta`` from an
    ``nptime``.

    I can't figure out a reason you'd want to add two times together without
    using ``timedelta`` objects, but if someone requests that, I'm happy to
    include it.

    ``nptime`` is `naive` about time zones.  I think this is the only way that
    makes sense, since days are only 24 hours long in an abstract sense.  But
    if you want to see a different system, pull requests are welcome..."""
